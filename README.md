# DSA-Maze-solver-project
We have created a maze solver by using Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path. And also use openCV for processing the maze image and fetch out the pixel values of the white and black color, these values we used to detect the boundaries in the maze.

After that we also implemented a simple UI for the maze solver. We did not need to write any traditional front-end code.we use Streamlit's library for UI . Streamlit’s ability to digest simple Python code, Streamlit intelligently re-runs the necessary parts of our script from top to bottom whenever the user interacts with the page or the script is changed. This allows for straightforward data flow and rapid development.
